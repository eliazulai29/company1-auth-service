# Only fail on HIGH severity issues for POC
# Medium/Low issues are warnings only

# B104: hardcoded_bind_all_interfaces (normal for containers)
# B201: flask_debug_true (normal for development)  
# B301: pickle usage (may be needed for serialization)
# B601: paramiko_calls (may be needed for SSH)
# B701: jinja2_autoescape_false (may be needed for templates)
